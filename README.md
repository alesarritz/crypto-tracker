## About this project
The Crypto Tracker project is the result of a 
challenge called **Bitcoin Ticker** belonging to this amazing 
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/">
Flutter Development Bootcamp</a>.

##The original project
The goal was to make a cryptocurrency price checking app using:
- DropdownButton Widget
- Cupertino Widgets (to provide a different user interface depending on the platform)
- Asynchronous programming
- APIs to get data from the internet 
- JSON parsing to manage the retrieved data
 
##Personalization
I performed three main changes:
- Design modification
- Implementation of Json serialization to better manage HTTP responses
- Implementation of Shared Preferences to save the responses offline. 
<br>This improves the app performance because it doesn't have to wait 
for http response for already made requests.

The last two points are viewable in the folder 
<a href="lib\utilities\coin_data_advanced"> coin_data_advanced </a> 
while the implementation that follows the original project guidelines is in
the file <a href="lib\utilities\coin_data_basic"> coin_data_basic</a>.
